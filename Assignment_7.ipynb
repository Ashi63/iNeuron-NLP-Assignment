BERT is a stack of Transformer encoders, which means that it consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks.\n",

    "The input to BERT is a sequence of tokens, which are first embedded into a high-dimensional vector space. BERT uses WordPiece embeddings, which break words into sub-words or character-level n-grams to handle out-of-vocabulary words. The input embeddings are then passed through multiple Transformer encoders to generate contextualized word representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of BERT is that it is pre-trained on a large amount of text data using two tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. In the masked language modeling task, a certain percentage of tokens in the input sequence are randomly masked, and the model is trained to predict the masked tokens based on the context of the other tokens in the sequence. In the next sentence prediction task, the model is trained to predict whether a pair of sentences appear consecutively or not.\n",

During the pre-training phase, BERT learns the general language features from a large corpus of text data. In contrast, fine-tuning involves training the model on a specific downstream task using a smaller dataset that is specific to the task. This smaller dataset requires fewer resources to process and fine-tuning takes less time than pre-training. Additionally, the BERT model already contains a lot of the knowledge that is needed to perform well on downstream tasks, so fine-tuning requires only a small number of updates to the pre-trained parameters to perform well on the target task."

Each decoder block has two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise feedforward network. The outputs of these two sub-layers are then passed through a residual connection and layer normalization. The multi-head self-attention mechanism allows the decoder to attend to different positions in the input sequence to generate the output, while the position-wise feedforward network applies a fully connected feedforward network to each position separately and identically. The decoder stack typically contains multiple decoder blocks, allowing the model to capture long-term dependencies and generate complex outputs. In GPT models, the decoder stack is used to generate natural language text, given an input prompt or context."
