    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network architecture that is designed to work with sequential data, such as time series or natural language processing tasks.

    "Vanishing gradients occur when the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network become very small as they are propagated backwards through the network during training. This can make it difficult for the network to learn long-term dependencies, as the gradients may become too small to update the weights of the network. In extreme cases, the gradients may become so small that the weights of the network stop updating altogether, resulting in a network that is unable to learn.\n",

    "On the other hand, exploding gradients occur when the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network become very large as they are propagated backwards through the network. This can cause the weights of the network to update too quickly, resulting in unstable training and poor generalization performance. In extreme cases, the gradients may become so large that they cause the weights to overflow, resulting in numerical instability.\n",

    "Both vanishing and exploding gradients are more likely to occur in deep networks with many layers, as the gradients must be propagated through multiple layers during training. To mitigate these problems, various techniques have been developed, such as weight initialization methods, activation functions that prevent saturation, and optimization algorithms that use gradient clipping or adaptive learning rates. In RNNs, architectures such as LSTM and GRU cells are also commonly used to address the vanishing gradient problem by allowing the network to selectively retain or forget information over time."
