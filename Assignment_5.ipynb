    "Vanilla RNNs suffer from the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients, which occurs due to the long-term dependencies in the sequences. As the sequence length increases, the gradients can become too small (vanishing) or too large (exploding), making it difficult for the network to learn long-term dependencies. This leads to poor performance in tasks that require modeling of long-term dependencies, such as language translation, speech recognition, and image captioning. Additionally, vanilla RNNs have a fixed-length context window, which means that they can only use a fixed number of previous inputs to predict the next output. This limits their ability to model complex sequences with variable-length dependencies."

    "Gradient clipping is a technique used to prevent the gradients from becoming too large during backpropagation in deep neural networks. When the gradients are too large, they can lead to unstable training and cause the model to diverge or overshoot the optimal weights. Gradient clipping involves setting a maximum threshold value for the gradients, such that if the gradient exceeds the threshold, it is clipped or truncated to that value. This helps to limit the magnitude of the gradients and prevent them from becoming too large, while still allowing the network to learn the important features of the input data. Gradient clipping is commonly used in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTMs and GRUs, where the vanishing or exploding gradients problem can be particularly pronounced."

In traditional sequence-to-sequence models, a fixed-length context vector is generated from the entire input sequence and used as input to the decoder to generate the output sequence. However, this approach can be limiting, especially when dealing with long sequences or when different parts of the input sequence are more important than others.\n",

These weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the input sequence elements, which is used as the input to the decoder for that step.\n",

Additive attention computes the weights by taking a dot product between a learnable parameter vector and the encoder hidden states, followed by a non-linear activation function. Multiplicative attention, on the other hand, computes the weights by taking a dot product between the decoder hidden state and the encoder hidden states. Self-attention is a variant of attention where the inputs are transformed using different linear projections and the attention mechanism computes the weights between the inputs themselves.\n",
